Limit definition	The formal definition of a limit of a function, stating that for every epsilon > 0, there exists a delta > 0 such that if the distance between x and a is less than delta (but not zero), then the distance between f(x) and L is less than epsilon. This formalizes the idea of a function's value approaching a specific number L as its input x approaches a specific number a.
epsilon-delta	A rigorous mathematical method used to define and prove the existence of limits, continuity, and other calculus concepts. It involves demonstrating that for any arbitrarily small positive value (epsilon), one can find another positive value (delta) that satisfies a specific condition.
continuity	A property of a function where small changes in the input result in small changes in the output, meaning the function's graph can be drawn without lifting the pen. Formally, a function f is continuous at a point 'a' if the limit of f(x) as x approaches 'a' exists, f(a) is defined, and these two values are equal.
differentiability	A property of a function at a point where its derivative exists, implying the function has a well-defined tangent line at that point and its graph is smooth, without sharp corners or vertical tangents. A function is differentiable if its derivative can be found, which measures the instantaneous rate of change.
L'Hôpital	A rule used to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms, such as 0/0 or infinity/infinity, by taking the derivatives of the numerator and denominator separately. It states that the limit of a quotient of two functions is equal to the limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided certain conditions are met.
Taylor expansion	A representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms, calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. It provides a polynomial approximation of a function around a specific point, becoming more accurate as more terms are included.
